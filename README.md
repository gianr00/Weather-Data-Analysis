Module 6 Challenge – Python APIs Homework:  What's the Weather Like?

Objective:

This project will apply the skills learned in Module 6 – Python APIs. This will apply the skills in retrieving API data and formatting them using JSON, saving them into csv file and plotting them for visualization.  This will also utilize the skills in searching places from Google API and creating heatmap.

Project Details:
This project includes two challenges using Python scripting, API’s data retrieval and plotting. 

1.    WeatherPy 
-    Creates a random list of cities of varying distance from the equator and retrieves the weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for each city
-    Saves the city data into a dataframe and exports them into csv file.
-    Visualizes the weather of the list of cities using scatter plots and linear regression

2.    VacationPy
-    Creates a humidity heatmap for the selected cities from the city data saved in csv file created in WeatherPy script. The cities list is narrowed down to 10 cities or less using 3 conditions.
-    Uses Google API to search for the first hotel for each city in the narrowed down list within 5,000 meters coordinates.
-    Plots the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the hotel name, city name and country.

Project Submission:
The following files will be saved in GitHub repository called “python-api-challenge”. A shareable link of the GitHub repository will be submitted to bootcamp spot site.
1.    The jupyter files for the two challenges scripts
2.    The city data csv file
3.    The plots and heatmap png files
4.    The written description of observable trends from WeatherPy results
5.    The README file
